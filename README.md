# Ragnar Engine

Ragnar Engine is a Video Game Engine created by [Lucas Pérez](https://github.com/LucasPG14). and [Oriol Bernal](https://github.com/UriKurae)., two students from the university Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (CITM). 

## Planning

The purpose of this project is to create a friendly-user, well optimized Game Engine for the subject "VideoGame Engines" from the 3rd year. The short term plan is to implement the basic features of a Game Engine, such as loading models, working in a 3D environment, etc...

For the long term, we would love to create a game with this Video Game Engine

## Installation

The installation is pretty straight-forward and easy, just go into the [releases tab](https://github.com/UriKurae/Ragnar-Engine/releases), and download the latest version.
The download files include an exe and you just have to execute it to test our engine.

**Carefull**: You can edit the config file to modify some properties like the window and everything, but they come with an optimal configuration already.

## Features

- Camera movement (Rotate, Move, Orbit, Focus).
- Drag and drop textures and models.
- Load and save the configuration.
- GameObject and components system (Transform component, Mesh Renderer and Material Component).
- GameObject options (Rename, activate, move in the hierarchy, delete).
- Inspector information (Transform, mesh renderer, material).
- Own basic shapes (Pyramid, Sphere, Cube and Cylinder).
- Saving images to DDS for lower size.
- Beautiful and usable UX (provided by ImGui).
- Debug options for GameObjects (Normals, Normal length, Normal color, etc...).
- System information (Console, Hardware, Software, etc...).
- Opengl options (Wireframe Mode, Texture2D, Vsync, Stencil, etc...).
- Ability to close and reopen menus from the editor.


## Controls

- Right click + WASD: Move the camera in it's own axis.
- Right click + Q/E: Move the camera up or down in it's own axis.
- Mouse scroll wheel: Move the camera forward and backwards in it's own axis.
- While selecting a GameObject and holding Alt + left click: Orbit the camera around the GameObject.
- While selecting a GameObject and pressing F: Focus the GameObject.
- Key T: Reset the camera (World axis reset).
- Right click GameObject in the hierarchy: Open GameObject options.

## User Interface

The menus are also very straight-forward, you can navigate through them and have multiple options for the engine itself, there are many options, so it's highly encouraged to test everything to understand the interface, **but keep in mind the following**:
- You can close any tab from the user interface, but don't worry, as you can re-open any window at any time.
- You can click and hold any tab to reallocate it anywhere you want.
